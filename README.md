## Points

- Set of routes - this is the real state
- Each route represents different state
- Global state - okay but really for what is globally required
- Can always get back to the page where you are working on (development)

- Problem of pipe components (?) - make smart / dumb components
- Monolith software - think of it as set of small apps
- NGRX / Redux is a great tool, and even if it got simpler it still is a bit tough to learn and can
  be an overkill

- recursive paths
- children paths
